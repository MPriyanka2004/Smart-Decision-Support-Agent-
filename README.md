## Smart-Decision-Support-Agent-

## Overview
This project implements a Smart Decision Support Agent for a Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) business using Azure Databricks.

It ingests multi-store, multi-SKU sales data, performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), builds Bronze–Silver–Gold data layers, simulates business scenarios, and provides natural-language insights via a CLI-based agent.

The project is implemented entirely using Databricks notebooks, following Databricks-native best practices.

## Objectives
Ingest historical CPG sales data

Perform EDA to understand data quality and business patterns

Build Silver and Gold analytical layers

Simulate “what-if” business scenarios (price hikes, promotions)

Enable NLP-based decision support using an agent loop

Validate the pipeline using notebook-based tests

## Notebook Details
### 01_Data_Loading_and_Silver_Gold
Purpose: Ingestion + Exploratory Data Analysis + Silver layer

Loads CSV data and creates the Bronze table

Performs EDA on Bronze data:

Data volume and granularity

Date range and coverage

Missing value checks

Revenue and units sold distributions

Region, category, store-size analysis

Promotion and holiday impact

Documents EDA insights using markdown

Creates the Silver table with cleaned and enriched fields

EDA results are exploratory and not persisted as tables.

### 02_Trend_Anomaly_Detection
Purpose: Analytics and Gold layer creation

Builds Gold tables from Silver:

      Monthly sales trends

      Promotion impact analysis
      
      Region and category performance
      
Validates seasonality and trend behavior

### 03_Scenario_Simulation
Purpose: What-if business simulations

Simulates scenarios such as:

    Price hike with demand drop
      
Uses Silver data

Focuses only on business impact modeling

### 04_Agent_Loop_Prototype
Purpose: Agentic AI logic
      Implements intent classification
      Converts analytical results into natural-language insights
      Acts as the core decision-support engine

### 05_CLI
Purpose: User interaction
      Provides a CLI-style interface inside Databricks
      Accepts business questions
      Displays NLP responses (not raw tables)

### Utility Notebooks
#### utils_agents
Intent classification
NLP response generation
Agent orchestration logic

#### utils_simulation
Business scenario simulations
Price hike and demand impact logic
These notebooks are reused via:

      %run ./utils_agents
      %run ./utils_simulation

### Data Layers
#### Bronze
Raw ingested data
    Table: cpg_sales_table

#### Silver
Cleaned and enriched data
Derived fields:
year, month
is_promo
revenue_per_unit
    Table: cpg_sales_silver

#### Gold
Business-ready aggregated insights:
    cpg_sales_gold_monthly
    cpg_sales_gold_promo
    cpg_sales_gold_region_category

## Testing
Testing is implemented using Databricks notebooks under the tests folder.
### Test Coverage
    Data pipeline validation (Bronze, Silver, Gold tables)
    Scenario simulation correctness
    Agent NLP response validation
Tests use assert statements and fail only if expectations are not met.
